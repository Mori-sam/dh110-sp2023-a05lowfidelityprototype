# DH110 Spring2023 A05: Low-Fidelity Prototype
### Yongsen Huang

## Description of the project
My app is designed to help users track the location of their families and driving conditions, providing a sense of ease and safety. The primary target users are people with families and those 17 or older who can drive. They can receive or provide their own safety information within their own family, reducing unnecessary worries for family members.

Based on the previous project, I have gathered information on two scenarios in which users will use this app. The goal of this low-fidelity prototype is to allow users to monitor and share their family members' driving status, such as phone usage while driving, speeding, hard braking, emergency calling, roadside assistance, total miles driven, and more. To achieve this, the user will need to set up all the phone call shortcuts and select one of the emergency calling options when they encounter an accident.

Now, let's move on to the second task. Users can customize the app, which includes a geofencing feature that allows them to define a customized area. The app will send notifications when a family member enters or leaves the area. To set up the area, the user should search or circle the map and customize it according to their needs.

## Tasks
First task - Calling emergency assistance:

1. Set up new emergency contact
2. Add the number in the correct input
3. Complete setups
4. Find the correct page
5. Click on the emergency calling button

Second task - Set up geofence space:

1. Click the add place button
2. Insert place address
3. Customize by adding label and special notes
4. Customize by expanding or shrinking the geofence circle
5. Complete setup

Click "Search" to look up the location where you want to set up a geofence, then input the necessary information. At the bottom, you can turn on or off notifications for when family members enter or leave the location. The customization button allows you to change the size of the geofence area coverage, as well as its name and color. When you are done, click "Save" to return to the home page.
