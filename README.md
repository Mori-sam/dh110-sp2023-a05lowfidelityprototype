# DH110 Spring2023 A05: Low-Fidelity Prototype
### Yongsen Huang

## Description of the project
My app is designed to help users track the location of their families and driving conditions, providing a sense of ease and safety. The primary target users are people with families and those 17 or older who can drive. They can receive or provide their own safety information within their own family, reducing unnecessary worries for family members.

Based on the previous project, I have gathered information on two scenarios in which users will use this app. The goal of this low-fidelity prototype is to allow users to monitor and share their family members' driving status, such as phone usage while driving, speeding, hard braking, emergency calling, roadside assistance, total miles driven, and more. To achieve this, the user will need to set up all the phone call shortcuts and select one of the emergency calling options when they encounter an accident.

Now, let's move on to the second task. Users can customize the app, which includes a geofencing feature that allows them to define a customized area. The app will send notifications when a family member enters or leaves the area. To set up the area, the user should search or circle the map and customize it according to their needs.

## Tasks
First task - Calling emergency assistance:

1. Set up new emergency contact
2. Add the number in the correct input
3. Complete setups
4. Find the correct page
5. Click on the emergency calling button

Second task - Set up geofence space:

1. Click the add place button
2. Insert place address
3. Customize by adding label and special notes
4. Customize by expanding or shrinking the geofence circle
5. Complete setup

Flow description:
> First, you start at the home page. To access the emergency page, click on "Emergency" in the navigation bar at the bottom. From there, click on the dropdown bar to see quick access to phone calls. Click the "+" sign to add more contacts. Once you have completed all the necessary information, click "Done" to return to the emergency page. If you do not wish to save anything, click "Back" to go back without saving.

> To set up a geofence, click on the big "+" sign with the words "Add a Place" on the home page. Click "Search" to look up the location where you want to set up a geofence, then input the necessary information. At the bottom, you can turn on or off notifications for when family members enter or leave the location. The customization button allows you to change the size of the geofence area coverage, as well as its name and color. When you are done, click "Save" to return to the home page.

Task 1 tester note:
> While working on the first task, the tester mistook the SOS calling shortcut button on the home page for the shortcut for adding an emergency contact. This was due to the button not being clearly labeled as a shortcut for SOS calling. Despite this confusion, the first task proceeded smoothly as it was not difficult or confusing. The buttons, dropdown list, and wording clearly directed the user to proceed to the next step.

Task 2 tester note:
> The tester started from the first homepage on the Figma board, which I had expected him to start from the second one. He had a little trouble understanding the directions when adding a place. He was confused by the buttons " + work", " + school", and " + favorite", and as a result, he connected the "+ work" button, which is intended to just re-customize an existing geofence. He then spent a bit longer time looking for the button where he could customize the geofence area. Fortunately, he eventually found it. He misunderstood the "Done" button as a way to return back to the homepage, but the directions were still clear. I should have labeled it as "Save" instead.

## Reflection
Based on prototype testing, I learned that my app is easy enough for users to understand and use most of its features. This was my intention, as my target users include young adults and elders who care about their family members. Additionally, the app includes a driving mode, so ease of use while driving is important. The first task performed by the user went very smoothly, except for the SOS calling button, which needs to be more symbolic and easier to understand, so users won't mistake it for a shortcut to customize emergency contacts. For the second task, my tester was confused by the icons I created for the existing geofence, mistaking them for a button to add a new geofence. I need to make the icons more specific and clear. Lastly, I will change the "Done" button on the second-to-last screen to "Save," so users know that they will return to the previous menu after saving their geofence customization. I also want to place the family members' icon at the top of the home page for easier access. Adding more shortcuts to features is something that I need to work on in the future.
